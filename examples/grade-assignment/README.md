# Grade Assignment Example

This example demonstrates conditional logic using nested IF statements to assign letter grades based on numeric scores.

## What it does

1. Assigns letter grades (A, B, C, F) for each subject based on score thresholds:
   - A: 90+
   - B: 80-89
   - C: 70-79
   - F: Below 70
2. Calculates overall average and assigns an overall grade
